Major changes in 0.4.3:

Features:
* Headless support has been added. Use dogtail-run-headless to spawn an X 
server, a minimal "Nat/Jeff" GNOME session, and execute a given dogtail 
script before exiting. The dogtail-detect-session script detects a running 
GNOME session, but KDE support can be dropped in once KDE has accessibility 
support.
* dogtail now uses a notification icon while it is running. Its tooltip is 
equal to the last message relayed by the debug logger. Most of the code was 
taken from jhbuild.
* Sniff, the AT-SPI browser that uses the dogtail libraries, has gained icons 
for both applications and specific widgets (based on the role name, taken 
from at-poke) to make browsing easier.
* Sniff also gained a proper dogtail icon.
* The procedural API has been given more convenience functions for 'focusing' 
different types of widgets.
* The procedural API has also been given an openItem() method, which works 
just like click(), for opening icons on nautilus' desktop.
* dogtail can now detect Gentoo and Conary distributions, thanks to Brent 
Smith and Tim Gerla, respectively.
* The Node class in dogtail.tree now exports the 'role' attribute in addition 
to the 'role name'.
* Wrappers for gcalctool and yelp were added, thanks to Dave Malcolm.
* A wrapper for gedit was added, thanks to Paolo Borelli.
* New examples for Evolution, gcalctool and the GTK file chooser were added, 
thanks to Dave Malcolm.
* Dave Malcolm also enhanced the Evolution wrapper, adding support for 
creating new meetings.
* A new example that generates fake documentation for a given application has 
been added, thanks to Dave Malcolm.
* dogtail.spec has been added, thanks to Jeremy Katz, to improve the quality 
of the RPM packages.

Bugfixes:
* several examples had not been updated to reflect API changes before the 
last release. This has been corrected.
* The epiphany wrapper now uses the package name 'epiphany-browser' on 
Debian-based distributions to detect the package version, thanks to Andrew Beresford.
