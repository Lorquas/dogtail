2006-01-26  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Fix automatic runtime translation. Stop using
	gettext.dgettext(), and instead use the gettext.GNUTranslations class
	and its member function, ugettext(). This ensures that we always get
	Unicode back. As a consequence, stop caring about "domains" and just
	deal with mo-files. Remove getTranslationDomainsForPackage(). Closes:
	#328652. Also, fix isMoFile()'s regexp matching.

2006-01-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Comment out the warning about missing wnck
	bindings, since the functionality is nonworking anyway.

	* NEWS: Add note about the last change to dogtail.tree.

2006-01-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py: Use codecs.open()
	instead of open() for reading the UTF-8 files. open() apparently
	ignores encoding issues, and codecs.open() allows us to specify the
	encoding of the file. Add comments to that effect.

	* dogtail/tc.py: Make a note in TC.compare()'s docstring that
	codecs.open() must be used to open any non-ASCII files that are
	intended to be compared using that function.

2006-01-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py: Make screenshot() raise a DependencyNotFoundError
	if ImageMagick is not installed.

	* NEWS: Add note about the last change to screenshot().

2006-01-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Add notes about dogtail.errors and the change to TCImage.

2006-01-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/errors.py: Add errors.py, a module for generalized
	exceptions, i.e. its first exception: DependencyNotFoundError. Other
	exceptions such as distro.PackageNotFoundError and
	procedural.FocusError probably do not belong here.
	
	* dogtail/tc.py: Give a better error message if TCImage is
	instantiated while ImageMagick is not installed, by raising a
	DependencyNotFoundError.
	
	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py: Remove unncessary
	TCImage instantiation. Also, be aware that the naming of the "Save as"
	dialog changed slightly. Try both strings.

2006-01-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* setup.py: Change author_email to dogtail-list@gnome.org.

2006-01-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* setup.py, dogtail/__init__.py, dogtail/apps/__init__.py, 
	dogtail/apps/wrappers/__init__.py: Bump version numbers.

2006-01-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* MANIFEST.in: Add NEWS file to tarball.

2006-01-05  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Update with changes since 0.4.3.

2006-01-04  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py: Add comment about how to
	turn on automatic translation.

2005-12-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Update to the new Action API.

2005-12-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add patch from David Malcolm to add a single
	shortcut method for Node.doAction('click') - simply Node.click() as a
	compromise. Closes: #321196.

2005-11-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py: Remove spurious print statement from screenshot().

2005-11-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Reformat to make more readable.

2005-11-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Re-add helper methods that were removed on 11-08.
	Change Action API from "Node.actionName()" to
	"Node.doAction(actionName)" for an action whose name is	'actionName'. 

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Update to new Action API.

2005-11-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* debian/control: Fix typo. Thanks to Alex Roitman for reminding me
	to commit this. Closes: #322169.

2005-11-22  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tc.py: Make TCImage.compare() work around a change in 
	ImageMagick that broke the method, by comparing its version string 
	against the one at which it changed. Closes: #321431.

2005-11-18  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/config.py: Add config parameter 'blinkOnActions'. The 
	parameter defaults to False. Set it to True to watch your scripts 
	blinken die lichten!

	* dogtail/tree.py: Make Action.do() call blink() on the associated
	node.

2005-11-18  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py: Add Blinker class from sniff/sniff, which, upon 
	initialization, blinks a rectangular shape onscreen.
	
	* dogtail/tree.py: Add Node.blink(), which blinks a rectangle around
	the node's extents (if it has extents). This is intended to help
	debugging situations where, during script writing, the node found in a
	search is not what was expeced.
	
	* sniff/sniff: Remove Blinker class and blinkExtents(). Make
	selectionChanged() just call node.blink().

2005-11-18  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Move blink interval constant into Blinker class. Make
	Blinker.__init__()'s count argument optional, defaulting to 2.

2005-11-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add Hyperlink and Hypertext support via the Link
	class (subclass of Node). Link objects have a roleName of 'hyper link'
	and a 'jump' action in Epiphany - I haven't tested Firefox yet.

2005-11-17  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add debug logging to Node.rawClick() and
	Node.rawType().

2005-11-17  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: reduce it to a single blink (2 calls of the callback) 
	rather than two blinks (4 calls) to avoid visual confusion when 
	rapidly changing the selection.   

2005-11-17  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: implement a selectionChanged callback for the tree 
	view; use it to make the extents of the selected node blink, porting
	code from at-poke's src/poke.c (though without the grabs that uses).
	Closes: #321655

2005-11-17  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: remove the unused "populate" function 

2005-11-16  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Properly catch an AttributeError where an
	AssertionError was previously expected. Closes: #321564:.

2005-11-16  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Make FocusDialog.__call__() pass
	recursive=False to FocusApplication.node.findChild(). Closes: #321624.

2005-11-15  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/logging.py: Make LogWriter print the name of the logfile
	just before it creates it.

2005-11-15  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/logging.py: Fix TimeStamp.zeroPad() by defaulting to
	width=2. Fix TimeStamp.fileStamp() by renaming 'long' argument to
	'addTime'.

2005-11-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Use {get,set}attr() inside
	FocusBase.__{get,set}attr__() instead of
	FocusBase.node.__{get,set}attr__(), in order to composite attributes 
	that aren't dynamically generated.

2005-11-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Fix compositing of Node properties into
	FocusBase subclasses.

2005-11-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Fix focusing. There are supposed to be three
	different focus 'slots': application, dialog, and widget. Previously
	Actions were not operating on the same nodes as FocusWidget as
	intended. Also remove a couple print statements left over from
	previous debugging.

2005-11-14  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/rawinput.py: rewrite pressKey() to take as an argument the
	English key name as seen on the keyboard, look its keysym up via a
	dict, and pass that value to AT-SPI to synthesize the event. This
	means each key will have to be added to the keySyms dict explicitly,
	but I think it's worth it for the API to make sense and be portable.
	Add docstrings to pressKey() and typeText().

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/logging.py: Fix TimeStamper.zeroPad()'s padding, and note in
	its docstring that it will not truncate.

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/predicate.py, dogtail/rawinput.py: Clean up imports.

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/rawinput.py: Add typeText() and pressKey(). For now 
	pressKey() takes an integer keycode argument, but I'd like to enable
	something like "pressKey('Return')" in the future.

	* dogtail/tree.py: Make Node.grabFocus() get added to the object in 
	Node.__init__(), but only of the node wraps a Component. Also add 
	Node.rawClick() and Node.rawType().

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Implement click(raw=True).

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Make FocusWidget.__call__() actually raise a 
	FocusError if it can't find what it's looking for.

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Add menu(), Focus.frame(), Focus.window().

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Add Node.position, Node.size, and Node.grabFocus()
	for those Nodes wrapping an AccessibleComponent.

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tc.py: Don't initialize TC's self.{baseline,undertest,result} so
	that TC.compare() defaults to failing. Make sure to assign
	self.{baseline,undertest} to the value of the arguments passed to
	compare(). Fix several unit tests to specify their strings as being
	Unicode-encoded. Strings comparisons now fail properly. Thanks to
	Muktha Narayan for reporting the bug and attaching a proposed patch. 
	Closes: #321151.

2005-11-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tc.py: s@scripts/pound@examples/data@g to reflect the
	directory naming that occured a while back.

2005-11-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Fix bogus logic in Node.__getattr__() where if, for
	example, a Node had multiple actions such that 
	node.actions[0].name == 'activate' and node.actions[1].name == 'menu',
	calling node.menu() would fail.

2005-11-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Remove "various wrapper/helper search methods": 
	Node.{child, menu, menuItem, textentry, button, childLabelled, 
	childNamed, tab}(). Node.menu() conflicted with the other Node.menu(),
	which is needed to execute the AccessibleAction's 'menu' action.

2005-11-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Fix "maximum recursion depth exceeded" error 
	in FocusBase.__getattr__() when 'help(dogtail.procedural)' is called 
	right after 'import dogtail.procedural'.

2005-11-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* Makefile: Build RPMs as a normal user. Thanks again to Bastien 
	Nocera for the patch! Closes: #320983.

2005-11-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail.spec: Make __os_install_post macro one line to fix building
	RPMs on RHEL4 and earlier. Thanks to Bastien Nocera for the patch. 
	Closes: #320978.

2005-11-03  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Add PackageDb.getMoFiles(), returning (mostly) 
	all the .mo files in the distro, optionally for just one locale. Move
	all PackageDb subclasses into the top level of the module, and prefix
	their names with a '_' so it is possible to subclass them. Add
	UbuntuAptPackageDb to make it possible for getMoFiles() to search in
	/usr/share/locale and /usr/share/locale-langpack. Add JHBuild class, a
	subclass of Distro, and JhBuildPackageDB class, a subclass of
	PackageDb. JhBuildPackageDB.getFiles() and
	JhBuildPackageDB.getVersion() are not implemented yet, as I haven't
	figured out just how they should work yet.

2005-11-03  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Make AptPackageDb only call apt_pkg.GetCache()
	once and save the cache object, to save time in the case where 
	multiple calls to getVersion() or getDependencies() need to be made.

2005-11-03  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Move *PackageDb class declarations and
	instantiations into their Distro classes' __init__() methods. Remove
	all __make*PackageDb() functions. Make dogtail.distro.packageDb a
	reference to dogtail.distro.distro.packageDb, where the second
	'distro' is the Distro subclass instance to preserve the API.

2005-11-02  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail.spec: Bump version number.

2005-11-02  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Save the value of the GConf key
	/desktop/gnome/interface/accessibility, then set it to true before
	running the test. After the test is run, restore the old value.
	Closes: #320548.

2005-11-02  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Preserve the return code of the script
	being exectued. Closes: #320535.

2005-11-01  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/evolution.py: added setBogusGConfAccountData()
	function as a way of bypassing the first-time wizard 

2005-11-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/config.py: Make config.ensureSensitivity False by default.

	* dogtail/tree.py: Make Action.do() spit out a warning if the Node
	instance is not sensitive and config.ensureSensitivity is False.

2005-11-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Implement a proper NotSensitiveError exception.
	Make Action.do() raise it instead of a string literal when the
	action's Node instance is not sensitive, and config.ensureSensitivity
	is True.

2005-11-01  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/logging.py: Change format of TimeStamp.fileStamp() to
	filename_YYYYMMDD-hhmmss or just filename_YYYYMMDD, controlled by the
	new optional argument 'long'. Fix docstrings of TimeStamp.fileStamp()
	and TimeStamp.entryStamp().

	* dogtail/utils.py: Rewrite most of screenshot(), and add assertions
	that config.scratchDir exists before the screenshot is taken, and that
	the screenshot file exists before the function returns. Generate
	screenshot filenames using logging.TimeStamp.entryStamp() by default. 
	A call like "screenshot(file='foo') will name the file
	'foo_YYYYMMDD-hhmmss.png', but the timestamping can be disabled with a
	call like "screenshot(file='foo', timeStamp=False)", naming the file
	just 'foo.png'. Additionally, the file argument may specify an
	extension, e.g. 'foo.png' or 'foo.jpg'. Make screenshot() return the 
	full path to the screenshot taken. Clarify screenshot()'s docstring.

2005-10-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Add URL to bug filed at bugzilla.redhat.com to the 
	note about popt making gettext.dgettext() bail.

2005-10-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Add an Ubuntu subclass of Debian, since Ubuntu in
	some cases does things wildly different. For a good example, see
	dogtail/i18n.py.

	* dogtail/i18n.py: Make automatic translation work on Ubuntu with a 
	special-case: If a script needing automatic translation is running on 
	Ubuntu, look for translations in the language-pack-gnome-$LANGUAGE 
	package before the actual package under test. Note that this makes 
	automatic translation significantly slower. Also, remove the 
	'dogtail' prefix from references to dogtail.config and dogtail.distro.

2005-10-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Only be verbose about setting a Node.text attribute
	if config.debugSearching is turned on.

2005-10-31  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py: Add automatic
	translation support (it's a one-liner!). Don't set $LANG from inside 
	the script. Add a line for config.debugTranslation, but comment both 
	debug lines out.

2005-10-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Implement proper Exceptions PackageNotFoundError
	and DistributionNotSupportedError.

2005-10-28  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Implement getFiles() and getDependencies() in
	AptPackageDb.

2005-10-28  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/i18n.py: New file, providing i18n facilities.
	
	* dogtail/config.py: Add debugTranslation boolean
	
	* examples/i18n-test.py: New example, demonstrating the i18n hooks
	
	* dogtail/tree.py: Add a getUserVisibleStrings() method to Node
	
	* dogtail/predicate.py: Rewrite all string matching within predicates to
	use the dogtail.i18n.TranslatableString class, and rewriting as
	necessary.

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/evolution.py: Use the evolution-connector
	package's translations by default.
	
	* examples/evolution-test-switching-components.py: Use the evolution
	package's translations
	
2005-10-28  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Use correct exceptions for unimplemented functions.
	Add getFiles and getDependencies methods to PackageDb; implement them
	for RpmPackageDb.   Fix the PATCH_MESSAGE to give the mailing list
	address.

2005-10-27  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/config.py: Rewrite. Rename the Config class to _Config, and
	provide a singleton instance named config. It is no longer necessary
	to instantiate a _Config instance in any script, whereas previously it
	was necessary to do so if any values needed to be changed. Also rename 
	logdir to logDir, scratch to scratchDir, and data to dataDir. When the
	*Dir values are changed, the new directory is created instantly if it 
	does not exist.	NOTE: this is an API change. Updating any scripts
	should be as simple as replacing 'Config' with 'config', 'logdir' with
	'logDir', 'scratch' with 'scratchDir', 'data' with 'dataDir' and
	removing any instantiations of the old Config class. Also, the old way
	of loading configuration values from a file is no longer supported.
	The current preferred method is to create a Python file that contains
	something like: "from dogtail.config import config; config.logDir =
	'../logs/'; config.debugSearching = True" and then import that file
	from whatever scripts need it.

	* dogtail/logging.py, dogtail/tc.py, dogtail/tree.py, 
	examples/firefox-test-browsing-local-html-file.py, 
	examples/gcalctool-test-fibonacci.py, 
	examples/gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py, 
	examples/gnome-panel-test-starting-every-app.py, 
	examples/google-search.py,
	examples/nautilus-test-icon-view-collage.py, examples/data/sample.cfg:
	Update to new config API.

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Update to new config API. Also, change "def
	run(application, arguments = None, appName = None):" to "def
	run(application, arguments = '', appName = ''):".
	
	* dogtail/utils.py: Update to new config API. Also, make run()'s appName
	argument default to "''" instead of "None", just like
	dogtail.procedural.run(). Also, make run() use doDelay() instead of
	sleep() to get logging for free via the config.config.debugSearching
	option.

2005-10-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/utils.py: Don't break if a filename is passed to
	screenshot().

2005-10-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/__init__.py, dogtail/apps/__init__.py, 
	dogtail/apps/wrappers/__init__.py, setup.py: Post-release version
	bump.

2005-10-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	Released 0.4.3.

2005-10-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Created with major changes since 0.4.2.
	
	* dogtail/__init__.py, dogtail/apps/__init__.py, 
	dogtail/apps/wrappers/__init__.py, setup.py: Bump version numbers.

	* dogtail.spec, debian/changelog: Add changelog entries for 0.4.3.

2005-10-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* icons/dogtail-head-48.png, icons/dogtail-head.svg, 
	icons/dogtail-tail-48.png, icons/dogtail-tail.svg: Add icons.

	* MANIFEST.in, setup.py: Add new icons to distribution.
	
	* dogtail/logging.py: Make IconLogger use the dogtail-tail icon.

	* sniff/sniff: Use the dogtail-head icon for the application. Use the
	theme's	desktop icon for the root node in the TreeView. If the then
	has an icon for any application displayed in the TreeView, use it.
	
	* sniff/sniff.desktop: Use the dogtail-head icon in the menu.
	
	* dogtail/trayicon.py: Fix typo.

2005-10-24  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Implement the FocusError exception properly.

2005-10-21  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/trayicon.py: Instead of totally bailing out if Python is
	older than 2.4, just make TrayIcon useless, as is currently the case
	if TrayIcon._runZenity() fails. What should really happen is for
	TrayIcon to actually work under older Python versions, I think.

2005-10-20  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/epiphany.py: Use the package name
	'epiphany-browser' on Debian-based distributions. Thanks to Andrew 
	Beresford for the patch.

2005-10-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail.spec, setup.py, debian/changelog, debian/copyright: Correct
	website URL.

2005-10-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/icons: Create directory.
	
	* sniff/*.xpm, sniff/icons/*.xpm: Move icons.
	
	* MANIFEST.in, setup.py, sniff/sniff: Update the icon locations.

2005-10-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* MANIFEST.in: Add sniff/*.xpm.

2005-10-19  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Add table() and tableCell() to Action and 
	FocusWidget. Allow run() to use utils.run()'s optional 'appName' 
	argument, for cases where the application's name is different from the
	binary's name.

2005-10-17  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/yelp.py: new file, wrapper for Yelp.

2005-10-17  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/predicate.py: add IsATabNamed class
	
	* dogtail/tree.py: add Node.tab() method

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/evolution.py: add Evolution.createMeeting()
	method; add AppointmentWindow and MeetingWindow subclasses

2005-10-14  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/evolution.py: Refactor createAccount, add 
	functions to run the first-time wizard (sharing code with account
	creation). Add a blowAwayEvolution function
	
	* examples/evolution-test-first-time-wizard.py: New example, testing
	the above. Blows away your evolution configuration, so use with 
	caution...
	 
2005-10-14  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/evolution.py: Fix wrapper so that it does not
	require a window, in preparation for wrapping the first-time assistant.
	
2005-10-13  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/trayicon.py: Added from jhbuild's jhbuild/utils/.

	* dogtail/logging.py: Add IconLogger class, a stripped-down version of
	jhbuild's TerminalBuildScript in jhbuild/frontends/terminal.py. Modify
	the DebugLogger class to additionally write messages to the
	IconLogger's tooltip. If zenity is not installed or not working
	properly, the DebugLogger should work exactly as before.

2005-10-13  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* examples/no-help-at-all.py: script which generates parodies of bad
	end-user documentation by simply converting reading the UI back in 
	DocBook form.

2005-10-12  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/gedit.py: Initial version, taken from Paolo 
	Borelli's home page.

2005-10-11  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Replaced a stray reference to "Search" with 
	"Predicate"

2005-10-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: rename open() to openItem() to avoid
	namespace collision.

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Ignore errors when restoring
	~/.xinitrc. If there was no previous ~/.xinitrc, make sure the
	temporary one isn't left behind. Increase hardcoded sleep delay.

2005-10-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* MANIFEST.in: Add scripts/ to tarball distribution.
	
	* setup.py: Install scripts/* .

	* setup.cfg: Add xorg-x11-Xvfb to requires for RPMs.
	
	* Makefile: Make 'deb' target run 'fakeroot debian/rules clean' before
	building a package.

	* debian/control: Add xvfb to Recommends for debs. 

2005-10-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Correct typo.

2005-10-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Restore the original ~/.xinitrc after
	the X server terminates.

2005-10-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Add focus.desktop (just a copy of tree.root).
	Later, I'll probably want to replace it with a FocusDesktop instance,
	but for now it's really just to make FocusApplication not break as
	horribly when there are no applications running.

	* scripts/: Created to hold scripts to be installed into /usr/bin/.

	* scripts/dogtail-detect-session: Add a script to detect if an
	accessibility-enabled session is currently running. Right now it
	obviously only looks for a GNOME session, but KDE support can be added
	when available.
	
	* scripts/dogtail-run-headless: Add a script to run a given dogtail
	script in a headless setup. Currently launches a minimalistic GNOME
	"session" under Xvfb, calls dogtail-detect-session, and if a session
	is detected, executes the dogtail script. Once the script terminates,
	so does the X server - Boom! Closes: #318537

2005-10-11  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/procedural.py: Add Focus.icon(). Add open() for opening
	icons on nautilus' desktop.

2005-10-10  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Move initial expansion from main to resetModel, so that
	we get the sane one-deep expansion on a Refresh, as well as when sniff
	starts. 

2005-10-10  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/filechooser-stress-test.py: Port to procedural API.

2005-10-10  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* examples/filechooser-stress-test.py: New file: repeatedly open and
	close the filechooser, for testing perfomance/profiling

2005-10-09  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* examples/gcalctool-test-fibonacci.py: New file: another test
	example. Drives gcalctool to calculate the Fibonacci series.

	* dogtail/apps/wrappers/gcalctool.py: New file: wrapper to help when
	writing gcalctool tests

2005-10-09  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* setup.py: Include sniff/*.xpm in the distribution.

	* sniff/sniff: modify loadIcon() to first search the current
	directory, then /usr/share/dogtail/icons. If distributions need to put
	them elsewhere, we can certainly accommodate them.

2005-10-09  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Revert API change - rename Action.doThisAction() to
	Action.do(). Add documentation in Node.__getattr__(), the only place
	it is used, to make it clear what is happening.

2005-10-09  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff.glade: Give the TreeView default focus.
	Really remove the Edit menu.
	
2005-10-09  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Add Dave as an author. 
	Correct the website URL and remove the License button in the About box.
	Remove 'Role name and 'Description' fields from the TreeView. 
	Change the packing on the TreeView to disable expanding.
	Stop importing pdb without using it.

	* sniff/sniff.glade: Change the 'Snoop' menu item name to 'Sniff' - 
	sniff used to be called snoop.
	Add keyboard shortcuts to all menu items.
	Remove Edit menu.

2005-10-09  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: added role attribute to Node (forgot to commit this
	earlier)

2005-10-09  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* sniff/button.xpm, sniff/checkbutton.xpm, sniff/checkmenuitem.xpm, 
	sniff/colorselection.xpm, sniff/combo.xpm, sniff/dialog.xpm, 
	sniff/image.xpm, sniff/label.xpm, sniff/menubar.xpm, 
	sniff/menuitem.xpm, sniff/notebook.xpm, sniff/scrolledwindow.xpm, 
	sniff/spinbutton.xpm, sniff/statusbar.xpm, sniff/table.xpm,

	sniff/unknown.xpm, sniff/viewport.xpm, sniff/vscrollbar.xpm, 
	sniff/vseparator.xpm, sniff/window.xpm: Add icons, copied from at-poke

	* sniff/sniff: add constants to represent the tree model columns; use 
	icons for nodes, based on code in at-poke. Requires up-to-date pyspi
	(for the role attribute)

2005-10-08  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* examples/recorder.py: Fix the imports so this works again.

2005-10-08  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* examples/evolution-test-switching-components.py: New example which
	repeatedly cycles through Evolution's components.

2005-10-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* sniff/sniff: Expand the root node of the TreeView on startup.

2005-10-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail.spec: Added, from Jeremy Katz.

	* MANIFEST.in: Add dogtail.spec.

	* Makefile: Rework 'rpm' target to call the 'tarball' target first,
	then build the rpm using dogtail.spec, using sudo if necessary. Also,
	make the 'tarball' target call the 'clean' target.

2005-10-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* examples/google-search.py: Fix call to findChildren(). Fix reference
	to predicate.GenericPredicate.

2005-10-08  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>
	* examples/firefox-test-browsing-local-html-file.py, 
	examples/gnome-panel-test-starting-every-app.py,
	examples/google-search.py,
	examples/nautilus-test-icon-view-collage.py:
	s/dogtail\.Config/dogtail.config.Config/

	support. Closes: #318224

	support. Closes: #318225

2005-10-07  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* ChangeLog: Add history since import, tweak formatting. Also add
	commit times (maybe we don't actually want them though, I'm not sure I
	care).

2005-10-07  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* examples/gedit-test-utf8-tree-api.py: Fix the example against
	changes to the API.

2005-10-07  David Malcolm <dmalcolm@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/tree.py: Provide a better warning for when import wnck 
	fails (it's a warning, not an error). Make Root.application() return
	an Application instance, rather than a mere Node.

	* ChangeLog: Created.

2005-10-07  Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

	* dogtail/distro.py: Minor indentation fix.
