(this is a work-in-progress)


== Formatting ==
We use 4 spaces for indentation.

== Python versions ==
We're trying to support both Python 2.3 and Python 2.4
In particular, this means:


=== No decorators ===
If you need to create a static method, use:
{{{
	def foo():
		print "bar"
	foo = staticmethod(foo)
}}}
rather than:
{{{
	@staticmethod
	def foo():
		print "bar"
}}}

since the latter way is not supported in Python 2.3
