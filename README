Using
=====

Currently only GNOME and GTK+ applications are supported. KDE 4 should have 
the accessibility support that will enable you to use dogtail with it.

First, enable accessibility support in your GNOME session with:
  gconftool-2 --type bool --set /desktop/gnome/interface/accessibility true
This only affects newly-started applications, so you may want to log out and 
log back in again.

Then, look at some of the example scripts. Run them, tweak them, write your own.

I suggest starting with gedit-test-utf8-procedural-api.py, as it's updated the
most often.
